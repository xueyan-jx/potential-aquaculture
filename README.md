# Prioritizing potential aquaculture

## Author
Xue Yan

## Project Description
This project aims to determine which Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) on the West Coast of the US are best suited to developing marine aquaculture for 
several species of oysters and Dungeness Crab. Suitable locations will be determined based on the range of suitable sea surface temperature (SST) and depth values for the species.

## Main skills used in this project
(1) Custom warning and error message 
(2) Coordinate reference system transformation
(3) Code test with "tryCatch"
(4) Raster data process (stack, crop, mask, resample, etc.)
(5) Data transformation ("matrix"/"array", "stars", "terra")
(6) Spatial join
(7) Map algebra and spatial statistics
(8) Function creation in R
(9) Visualization with "tmap"
